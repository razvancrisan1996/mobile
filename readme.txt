Create a mobile application build in React-Native and Android that calculates how many calories you burned during a workout.
The app has two kind of users: user, that can register himself and add, update, delete his own activities and also can see charts about the calories he burned in a period of time;
admin, that can block a user. When you create a new account, you have to introduce a username, your gmail, a password but also your age, weight and genre.
You can update your account whenever you want. After register, you will receive instantly a welcome mail. 
When you want to introduce a new activity, you will have to introduce its description, duration and difficulty. 
It can be 5 levels of difficulty: low, low_moderate, moderate, moderate_high and high. If you don't add new workouts for at least 30 minutes/day you will receive a 
"You are a little bit lazy" notification. If you do not have connection to internet but still want to add an activity, it will be stored on a local storage, 
being added in database when your internet connection will be on.
